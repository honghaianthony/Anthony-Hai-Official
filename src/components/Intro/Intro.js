                                    I was born and raised in Khanh Hoa, Vietnam.
                                    I was just an ordinary person like everyone
                                    else, but I had a passion for computers
                                    since 6th grade. This passion motivated me
                                    to have a love for IT.
                                    <br /> <br />
                                    Started learning everything about coding
                                    when I graduated from 12th grade. Although
                                    it was late but I tried my best everytime.
                                    <br /> <br />
                                    My dream is to become a Web Developer so
                                    that I can satisfy my passion for
                                    Information Technology.

                                I started my journey when I was an elementary
                                student at Dien An 1 Primary School. This was
                                the first school as long as the first public
                                place where I met my first friends in my life.

                                    Next time, when I was a secodary student at
                                    Tran Nhan Tong Secondary School, I achieved
                                    some success in my education path,
                                    especially in English.
                                    <br /> <br /> During my secondary time,
                                    every year I won awards for Internet English
                                    contests (IOE). The highest prize I won is
                                    the provincial consolation prize.
                                    <br /> <br /> In 8th grade, I was in English
                                    team and won some certain awards.

                                    In high school, I studied at Hoang Hoa Tham
                                    High School. This time was the happiest
                                    moment in my life time. I met a lot of new
                                    friends.
                                    <br /> <br /> In high school, I didn't join
                                    any activities so I could focus on the
                                    university entrance exam.

                                In 12th grade, I participated in many
                                activities. The most impressive activities was
                                Flashmob with my classmate. We practiced for a
                                month to give the best performance of our
                                student life.

                                    At the end of grade 12, I was honored to be
                                    one of the students participating in the
                                    seminar on excellent students of Khanh Hoa

                                The 12th grade anniversary is the most memorable
                                when we have experienced many emotions, many
                                activities together and always remember each
                                other when talking about it.{" "}

                                After that, I took the National High School exam
                                and got into the University of Information
                                Technology and started a new journey when I
                                lived independently in dormitory with new
                                friends in Ho Chi Minh City. Here I understood
                                more about the life of students away from home
                                and had been living happily with friends in the
                                room every day.
                                <br /> <br /> At this school, I learned many
                                things about IT and together with my team over
                                the semesters have created amazing apps
